# Page templates, generated and non-HTML pages

## Background

Page templates, generated and non-HTML pages — the index pages and 404 as page templates
(D41), photo and TIL topic pages as generators (D43), three feeds (rss + two atom,
`/feed.xsl`), `sitemap.xml` with video entries: the last pages on WebC and 11ty plugins
(`eleventy-plugin-rss`, pagination, `sitemap.njk`). A feed renders in a second phase,
reading other pages' finished output as a string source (D42)
